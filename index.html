    <h4>OUR STRATEGY</h4>
    <p>This is a sponsorship platform where students from needy backgrounds have access to scholarship opportunities. There is a wide range of opportunities,ranging from O-levels all the way up to PhD levels. 
        There are also opportunities for those interested in technical courses. These include vocational and technical training institutes. For those who have a passion in IT, there are scholarships available for bootcamps.
        We aim to provide legitimate information to prevent pontential beneficiaries from being conned under the guise of sponsoring their education.
