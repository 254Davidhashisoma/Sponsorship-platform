    <h3 id="head">OUR STRATEGY</h3>
    <p>This is a sponsorship platform where students from needy backgrounds have access to scholarship opportunities. There is a wide range of opportunities,ranging from O-levels all the way up to PhD levels. 
        There are also opportunities for those interested in technical courses. These include vocational and technical training institutes. For those who have a passion in IT, there are scholarships available for bootcamps.
        We aim to provide legitimate information to prevent pontential beneficiaries from being conned under the guise of sponsoring their education.
    </p>
    <p>We aim to change the livelihoods of these young scholars by providing them with the opportunity to access quality education through these scholarship programs. We have a brief introduction to every foundation/institution that is offering these scholarship opportunities on our page. After reading 
        about the scholarship on our page, the applicant can proceed to click on the link at the end of the brief description. There's a range of foundations and institutions to choose from.
